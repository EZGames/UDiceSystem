		<h2>Progress Report: April 24, 2014</h2>
	   <p>I largely started over. Don't worry; there was nothing necessarily wrong with it before, I just decided that I really wanted to do TDD and make sure that there was no extra code in the library that wasn't being used.  I felt like I had put in several methods for each of the model objects that had either been a just-in-case sort of thing or they were outmoded as my idea of how to implement the system evolved.</p>
		<p>I've really been enjoying what comes with TDD, and even after-the-fact-testing.  Since I decided not to erase and redo my utility classes, I've been doing some testing on those too.  It's helped me find quite a few little bugs (especially in my Iterators for my custom collection classes) and also to make improvements toward better reuse-ability, thus reducing the number of classes I need to make for a deep hierarchy.
