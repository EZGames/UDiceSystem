{"name":"UDice - the Universal Dice System","tagline":"","body":"![](https://ezgames.bitrix24.com/workgroups/group/16/files/Images/UDiceSystemFullLogo.png)\r\nBy Jacob Zimmerman\r\n###Never again will you need to install multiple dice rollers just to handle the different sets of crazy dice that all your favorite games use! The UDice System is a project meant to be used to represent _any_ die or dice mechanic on the market!\r\nThe UDice System looks at the idea of dice in a completely new way. It'll require a little bit of a learning curve, but considering it was thought up as I was going to sleep, I think you'll be able to catch on fairly quickly.  \r\nAs an open-source java system, the UDice System can be used by people to make their own dice-rolling applications for any platform. When someone creates a new set of dice, they can share it with the world to be plugged into whichever UDice roller they use.\r\n>It is currently in production, nowhere near ready to use.  A rough estimate of when the basic parts of the system will be ready is around Christmas 2014.  In the coming months, I will hopefully be putting up tutorials on how to use the system.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
