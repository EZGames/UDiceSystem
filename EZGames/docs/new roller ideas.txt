Custom dice:
-reroll (triggering roll doesn't count) or roll additional time ("exploding")
-custom values(hit, comet, etc)
-face relationships
--canceling each other out
--a relationship simply applies different numeric values to different die values to a single total, which can have different output labels for different ranges of that total
---ex. to cancel out successes with failures, you have successes count as +1 to the total, and failures count as -1 to the total. Example output labels can be "# successes" for a range of 0, and >2, "# success" for a range of 1, and "failure" for a range of <0.
-multiple values per face(success and fatigue, etc)
-see other roller for other custom dice options

Custom rolls:
-option 1: "equation" builder
--very similar to current roller
-option 2: equation editor
--type in what you want
--must be numeric dice have access to all mathematical functions
---addition and subtraction can be used to add the custom values in; multiplication can be used alongside the addition and subtraction to specify how many of that value
--syntax ideas: [die name or roll name] {due value}
-can be cloned between saved sets

Roller: (pool roller)
-each die button has 0, -, and + button
-button to clear all pools
-drop/keep highest/lowest # dice (applies to numeric dice only, unless I want to add in a ranking to the face) 

Balanced pools:
-ex. no more than 4 total dice; you raise the number of one, and it decreases the number of another to keep the total at 4
-created as a single roll in a saved dice set
