/**
 *There are a few major things to notice in this collections package:
 *<ol>
 *	<li>The {@link SimpleCollection} interface</li>
 *	<li>The {@link Stackable} interfacte</li>
 *	<li>The {@link RandomElementChooser} class</li>
 *	<li>The two new collections, {@link ZArray} and {@link MlList}
 *</ol>
 *<p> It all started with ZArray.  I wanted to use a small, fast, and immutable
 *collection within my model objects.
